[Weaverjs](https://github.com/lecoueyl/weaverjs.com) is an opinionated boilerplate for web development based on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Pug](https://pugjs.org/).

It helps you by automating website builds and let you focus on writing only reusable modules for html, css and javascript.
You can visit the [repository](https://github.com/lecoueyl/weaverjs) of Weaverjs's homepage to have an usage example.

*Note: Weaverjs is a guideline and it doesn't solve everything. It is up to you to modify whatever necessary to achieve your project goals and dreams.*

## Quickstart

```
npm cache clear && npm i && npm run gulp
```

*Note: Before you can install packages, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). It 's recommanded to use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) to manage them*

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Generate a fresh build of your project. Task will run several individual tasks on files within `./src` and then output them to `./dist`.

### Environments

You can specify which environment you want to build. Development environment is used by default when building without option.

#### Development

```
npm run dev
```

#### Stage

```
npm run stg
```

#### Production

```
npm run prd
```

## Server

Start a local dev server with. Additionally, gulp will watch for any changes to files and reload browser while server is running.

```
npm run gulp server
```

## Deploy


### Github Pages

If you want to host your site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), you can deploy directly a production version on the `gh-pages` branch. Therefore, you have to already commit once your project on a Github repository.

```
npm run github
```

### Local URLs

* Local - http://localhost:3000
* UI - Set to `false` by default

### Options

You can modify port, proxy, and many other settings in `./gulpfile.babel.js`. For more information about BrowserSync go to [http://www.browsersync.io/](http://www.browsersync.io/).

## Assets

Run several individual tasks to copy static files from `./src` to `./dist`.

```
npm run gulp assets
```

### Fonts

Copy font files to `./dist/fonts`.

```
npm run gulp fonts
```

### Images

```
npm run gulp images
```

Copy images to `./dist/images`. As a personal preference Weaverjs doesn't use automated image optimization. It is strongly recommended to use services like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) and [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) to optimize images manually.

### Media

```
npm run gulp media
```

Copy media files to `./dist/media`.

### Miscellaneous

Copy miscellaneous files, such as `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`, to the root of `./dist`. If your project require custom settings per environment, then you can save individual files into appropriate directory within `./src/misc`.

```
npm run gulp misc
```

### Vendors

```
npm run gulp vendors
```

Bundle vendor files to `./dist/vendors`. You can install new client-side vendors using npm, then reference appropriate files in `./src/vendors/bundle.js` and `./src/vendors/bundle.min.js`.

#### Jquery example

Add jquery package in `package.json`
```javascript
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "jquery": "^x.x.x",
  ...
}

```

Reference it for development in `./src/vendors/bundle.js`
```javascript
// =include jquery/dist/jquery.js
```

And for minified version in  `./src/vendors/bundle.min.js`
```javascript
// =include jquery/dist/jquery.min.js
```


## Scripts

```
npm run gulp scripts
```

Run a series of sub-tasks to generate final JavaScript files.

*Note: Each file on the root of `./src/scripts` will be compiled to its own file in `./dist/scripts`. Each file can have own includes, just like Sass with `@import` functionality. See `./src/scripts/main.js` as an example.*

## Styles

```
npm run gulp styles
```

Run a series of sub-tasks to generate final CSS files. See `./gulpfile.babel.js` for reference.

*Note: Each file on the root of `./src/styles` will be compiled to its own file in `./dist/styles`.*

### iotaCSS

Weaverjs use [iotaCSS](https://www.iotacss.com) SASS based OOCSS framework built for scale.

## Views

```
npm run gulp views
```

Run a series of sub-tasks to generate final HTML files. See `./gulpfile.babel.js` for reference.

### Pug Structure

Weaverjs follows an opinionated directory structure. To learn more about Pug go to [https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html/](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html/).

### Environment Variables

Every Pug file has access to global `env` variable. You can use it to conditionally load unminified/minified assets. See `./src/views/includes/head.pug` as an example.

### Contributing

1. Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

### Inspiration

Weaverjs is inspired by [web-starter-kit-gulp](https://github.com/KrisOlszewski/web-starter-kit-gulp) by @KrisOlszewski
